# TypeORM MongoDB Review

I recently started using TypeORM in a project with MongoDB and thought I’d share my thoughts on it.

TypeORM is typically used with SQL databases, but also has basic MongoDB support. Before I deciding to use TypeORM I tried doing some research online, but not too much came up. Others mentioned they were using it and it worked well enough for them, but didn’t go into too much detail. Hopefully this post covers those missing details for you and all the pain points you’ll face

A quick summary of TypeORM from the homepage for those that haven’t used it before:
TypeORM is an ORM that can run in NodeJS, Browser, Cordova, PhoneGap, Ionic, React Native, NativeScript, Expo, and Electron platforms and can be used with TypeScript and JavaScript (ES5, ES6, ES7, ES8). Its goal is to always support the latest JavaScript features and provide additional features that help you to develop any kind of application that uses databases — from small applications with a few tables to large scale enterprise applications with multiple databases.
TypeORM supports both Active Record and Data Mapper patterns, unlike all other JavaScript ORMs currently in existence, which means you can write high quality, loosely coupled, scalable, maintainable applications the most productive way.
TypeORM is really popular for SQL, but the go to solution for Mongo is Mongoose (621,194 weekly npm downloads).
Mongoose does its job and is battle tested, but I have felt it to be a little cumbersome to use at times. For the project I’m working on it would have been more than fine. I wanted to see what else was out there.
One area where things could be nicer with Mongoose is when using it with TypeScript. If you want TS type support for your models, you need to define both the Mongo schema and the TypeScript types. I use GraphQL on almost all my projects too, which means having to define 3 different types for each collection.
One way to solve this problem with Mongoose is using a library called Typegoose which automatically generates TS types for you from your Mongoose models. I haven’t used this library so can’t comment on it, but it looks promising.
Another solution is to use TypeORM which will also auto generate the TS types for you.
There are unfortunately many basic features missing from TypeORM for MongoDB and this is the list of items I wish I had read before getting started with it:

## Comenzando

# Titulo 2
Instalar Vue CLI


```bash
@CreateDateColumn({ type: 'timestamp' })
createdAt: Date

@UpdateDateColumn({ type: 'timestamp', nullable: true  })
updatedAt?: Date
```

una vez que se instala Vue CLI, podemos crear un proyecto Vue ejecutando:

<Card>
    Hola
</Card>

```bash
vue create x_name_of_project
```

depues de terminar la creacion entramos al directorio

```bash
cd x_name_of_project

```
es instalamos vuetify para la UI y `@vue/composition-api` que nos permitira
usar la sintaxis de vue 3'

```bash
npm i @vue/composition-api
npm i vueitfy
```
